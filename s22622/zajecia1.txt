06.03.2021    Instalacja systemu Linux na maszynach wirtualnych 

During classes we instaled Linux distribution - Debian.
We analized avalible configuration options and personalized our selections.

Process description below.

1. Download system installation image from debian.org
	I chose "small image file" for 64-bit PC "amd64"
	
2. In VirtualBox manager we create new virtual machine.
	I chose "Maszyna" -> "Nowa"

   a) I named it "debian" / defined folder path /chose version 64-bit.
   b) Operational memeory - I declared 2048 MB 
	It have to be ????????
   c) In next step I created new virtual hard drive  
   d) I chose format VDI(VirtualBox Disc Image) 
	Options: 
	-VDI(VirtualBox Disc Image)- format dedicated for VirtualBox (it means communication is better)
	-VHD (Virtual Hard Disc) - Microsoft format , better if you need to move things between those systems it will be easier but does't work very well.  
	-VMDK (Virtual Machine Disc)- for VMware
   e) "memory on a physical hard disk"- chose dynamic
	Options:
	- Dynamic allocation - initially it will be small and will grow to maximum size during creation of the disc itself
	- Fixed size- maximum size right from the start, file with for example VirtualDriveImage will be prelocated and zeroed from the start.
   f) "file location and size"- i changed the size to 16GB
   

3. Settings (right mouse button on debian icon)

   a) system/motherboard
	- unchecked "floppy" and "optical drive" (only for initial boot sequence. This does not remove them from VM)

	C. internal network - comunication of two virtual machines but without connection with "orygina" computer
	D. isolated network card - comunnication between "oryginal/host" computer and virtual machine
	E. generic driver
